            <p1>Animation &#38; Motion Graphics:</p1>
            
            <br><br>
            
            <p2>The Animation and Motion Graphics program provides students with the fundamentals of two- and threedimensional
(2D and 3D) animation, motion graphics, and special effects. Once necessarily hand-made, expensive
and rare, animation has undergone a technical transformation and is now a ubiquitous part of special effect,
advertising campaigns, video games, movies, and television.</p2>
            
            <br><br><br>
            
            <p3>Upon completion of the program requirements, the Associate of Science degree in Animation and Motion Graphics
is awarded. Graduates of this program can enter a growing profession or transfer to bachelor-level programs in
Animation at Lehman College or other media related programs at senior colleges.
